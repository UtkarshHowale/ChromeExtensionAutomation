About the Project:


The Chrome Extension Google Dictionary Automation project is designed to automate testing for the Google Dictionary Chrome extension. It uses the Selenium WebDriver for browser automation, Java as the programming language, and the TestNG testing framework. The project is structured using the Page Object Model (POM) to enhance code readability and maintainability. Extent Reports are used for detailed test reporting.

Features:

    1. Automate testing for the Google Dictionary Chrome extension.
      
    2. Implements the Page Object Model (POM) for better code management.
      
    3. Uses TestNG for executing and managing test cases.
      
    4. Supports different test suites: Smoke, Sanity, Regression.
      
    5. Generates detailed Extent Reports for test results.
      
    6. Uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts to design the framework.

Technologies Used:

    1. Automation Tool: Selenium WebDriver
    2. Programming Language: Java
    3. Testing Framework: TestNG
    4. Design Pattern: Page Object Model (POM)
    5. Framework Type: Hybrid Framework (combination of keyword-driven and data-driven)
    6. Reporting: Extent Reports
    7. Build Tool: Maven
    8. OOP Concepts: Used for implementing and structuring the framework

TestNG Configuration:

    Smoke Tests: Basic functionality tests to ensure the most critical features are working.
  
    Sanity Tests: Small set of tests focusing on specific functionalities.
  
    Regression Tests: Comprehensive tests that cover the entire application functionality to ensure that new changes do not affect existing features.

Reports:

    Test execution reports are generated using Extent Reports and can be found in the Reports folder.
  
    Screenshots are automatically captured on test failures and stored in the Screenshots folder for debugging purposes.
